# Chapter 2 - Program Structure

## Expression vs statement
Expresion
- Expresions produce values
- Can be a smaller part of a statement
Examples 
- 5 (number literal)
- 2 + 3 (arithmetic expression)
- "hello world" (string literal)
- x > 10 (comparison expresion)
- greet("hello world") (funtion call expression)

Statements
- "a full sentence"
- performs an action
- a complete instruction that tells javascript to DO something
- should end in a semicolon
Examples
- let x = 5; (a variable definition)
- if (x > 10) {console.log("bigger number");} (a conditional statement)
- for (let i = 0, i < 5, i++) {console.log(i); } (a loop statement)

Expression prodcues a value
Statement performs an action

## Bindings
- Think of bindings as tenticles rather than containers because the bindings can change, 'they do not contain values, they grasp them'
